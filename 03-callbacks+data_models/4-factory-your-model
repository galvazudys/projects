Create a factory that returns copies of your data model:
 
  modelFactory: function
    args: 2
      name: string
      schema: schema object
    return: new dataModel object initialized with the schema and name
    behavior:  sets the 'schema' and 'name' properties and returns the new model
    purpose: to create a model object for each type of data in your *Book project
  
 After this step you are ready to move on to *Book.  Step 5 in this project is optional.
 
 challenge:  use the constructor design pattern to create model objects that inherit their methods.
