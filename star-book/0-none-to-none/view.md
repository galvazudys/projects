IEW.JS:  all funcitonality connected to making something visible on screen (the DOM)  
  * VIEW: object
    * METHODS: minimum 2
      * HOME: 
        * ARGS: whatever it takes to draw the home page
        * RETURN: undefined
        * BEHAVIOR: draws the home page
      * PROFILE: 
        * ARGS: 1
          * PROFILE_OBJECT: a profile object
        * RETURN: undefined
        * BEHAVIOR: draws the profile page filling in all variables with values from the passed profile object

Depending on how you choose to manage update and delete, you may have extra methods.  Or you may have extra methods to redraw small bits of HOME and PROFILE, or you may choose to add entire new pages.  
With these projects all we care about is that you learn certain back-end principles.  You are completely free to do the views how you like.
